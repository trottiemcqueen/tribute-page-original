        paragraph overview about New Project - magazine
      </p>
      <p>
          After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and
          when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel
          possible: the flux capacitor!
      </p>
      <p>
          It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The
          revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just
          have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out
          how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)

      <p><!--Rough Draft - not original content that I will use-->
        No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up a working
        project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding
        fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into
        projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real
        life has plenty of repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into
        a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire
        time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after another, quickly
        building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they build the
        required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from the
        beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

        <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>
            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
            <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database
              Class.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
            <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
            <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
            <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each
              had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still
              using external resources like Node School.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
            <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
            <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.</p>
          </li>
